It is currently a work in progress. Please continue reading for a description of current and future functionalities.

Current Functionalities:

1. The character, Miko, is generated upon game start.
2. The first game setting, a park, is generated upon game start.
3. Miko is animated, and has profiles for left - right - top - down movement.
4. Miko will not collide (aka pass through) static groups (trees and shrubs).
5. Dog bones are placed around the gameboard for Miko to collect.
6. Dog bones may be collected by Miko and disappear upon contact.

Future Functionalities:

1. Create an overall objective for all game levels.
2. Create more levels once overall game objective is determined.
3. All the art for Miko Adventures are original creations. If you would like to -provide art or collaborate on the code, please feel free to reach out to me -or to create a pull request!

Please enjoy the game :)
